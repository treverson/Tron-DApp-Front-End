                                visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as
                                billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Health

                                easily use the Health Port features that you customized. <br><br> You have the ability
                                to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you
                                can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose
                                to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of

                                hereof, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise at law or in equity for damages or any
                                other relief, then such dispute shall be resolved only by final and binding arbitration
                                pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and
                                administered by the American Arbitration Association, or a similar arbitration service
                                selected by the parties, in a location mutually agreed upon by the parties. The
                                arbitrator's award shall be final, and judgment may be entered upon it in any court
                                having jurisdiction. In the event that any legal or equitable action, proceeding or
                                arbitration arises out of or concerns these Terms and Conditions, the prevailing party
                                shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorney's fees. The parties
                                agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims in regards to these Terms and Conditions or
                                any disputes arising as a result of these Terms and Conditions, whether directly or
                                indirectly, including Tort claims that are a result of these Terms and Conditions. The
                                parties agree that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
                                enforcement of this provision. The entire dispute, including the scope and
                                enforceability of this arbitration provision shall be determined by the Arbitrator.
                                This arbitration provision shall survive the termination of these Terms and Conditions.

                                on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class/representative/collective actions
                                are not permitted. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT A PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER

                                PUTATIVE CLASS, COLLECTIVE AND/ OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, SUCH AS IN THE FORM OF A
                                PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER. Further, unless both you and Health
                                Port agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims,
                                and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>
